# The Winning Strategy in Fundraising Sites: The Use of Seed Money for Campaigns

There is a numerous number of studies that conducting research about the effect of seed money on charitable giving. Most of them agree that seed donation will boost people's donation as well. However, most of them are experimental studies, either field or laboratory study.

This research wants to bring the academics finding from seed donation to a more practical world. In particular, the main objective of this research is to know whether the strategy of putting seed donation to a campaign in a fundraising site would be a good strategy to increase the willingness of the site visitors to donate to the campaign and their donation size. By putting a seed donation to a campaign, it shows that the campaign has progressed and already collected some amount of money to the visitors of the fundraising site. 

To achieve this objective, this study observes number of people donating and their amount of donations along the progress to the completion of campaigns in one of crowdfunding sites in Indonesia, Kitabisa. From the result, we can study how people's willingness to donate, and their donation amount might be affected by a campaign's progress toward reaching its goal. 

From the result, I found that while the participation rate increases incrementally in the beginning period, it decreases when the campaigns are about halfway to the end state. I demonstrate that while making a seed donation boosts participation rates in the early stages, as people perceive marginal value of progress to the initial state, this decreases their motivation for the campaign which is about to achieve its target amount.

With all the findings from this study, it is strongly advised for any fundraisers and campaigners to put a little amount of seed money on their campaign, around 10% - 30% of the target.
