# The Influence of Seed Donation in Multiple Public Goods Setting: Evidence from Kitabisa 

There is a numerous number of studies that conducting research about the effect of seed money on charitable giving. However, it is rare to find a study that research this topic with multiple public goods setting even though most of crowdfunding sites are using this mechanism. This study observes the effect of seed money in multiple public goods by observing the progress bar of campaigns in one of crowdfunding sites in Indonesia, Kitabisa. 

While the participation rate increases incrementally in the beginning period, it decreases when the campaigns are about halfway to the end state. I demonstrate that while making a seed donation boosts participation rates in the early stages, as people perceive marginal value of progress to the initial state, this decreases their motivation for the campaign which is about to achieve its target amount. This study opens the possibility for future research to include the availability of public goods and how individuals value the progress in the seed donation model.
